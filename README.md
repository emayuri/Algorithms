# Emergency Vehicle Dispatching System
A web application that dispatches the nearest emergency vehicle to the desired location based on the type of emergency.

A web application implemented using ASP.net, using which emergency vehicles can be requested. The system would choose closest available vehicle and display the vehicle ID and distance at which it is available. The shortest path calculation is computed using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
